# ♟️ The Process:
There's a lot of murmuring about the Ai bubble, it strikes similarities to the .com bubble, so who are the husters and who are the current winners and who are going to be the future players within this market? I wanted to really gain an understanding on the current outlook for Ai companies and use cases in an attempt to predict longevity within finance, design, coding, entertainment, and any other markets that crossed my path through my research. The Method: Scraping Social media platforms, Annual buisiness/gov reports, Research papers, and Geographic data to narrow sentiments and build a tell on the positioning and seen longevity in the global Ai driven parts of the economy.
