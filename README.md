# ♟️ The Process:
There's a lot of murmuring, fear & conjecture surrounding the Ai bubble- (it strikes a lot of similarities to the 1990s .com bubble) so I set out to discover who will be the winners and who will be the losers of this new economy. As a start, I wanted to really gain an understanding on the current outlook for Ai companies and use cases in an attempt to predict their longevity within finance, design, coding, entertainment, and any other markets that crossed my path. The Method: Scraping Social media platforms, Annual buisiness/gov reports, Research papers, and Geographic data to narrow sentiments on their longevity and build a tell on their positioning & flow of profit in the global Ai driven economy.
